# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for cleaning up and improving the codebase structure, configuration, and organization. The goal is to fix inconsistencies, improve type safety, and ensure a more maintainable project structure.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a consistent and well-organized project structure so that I can easily navigate and maintain the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the project structure THEN the system SHALL have a logical and consistent directory organization.
2. WHEN looking at component organization THEN the system SHALL have a clear separation between feature-specific and shared components.
3. WHEN examining the file structure THEN the system SHALL NOT have any incorrectly named or misplaced directories.
4. WHEN navigating the codebase THEN the system SHALL follow a consistent pattern for organizing related files.

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want improved TypeScript configuration so that I can catch type errors early and ensure better code quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing TypeScript code THEN the system SHALL enforce appropriate type checking rules.
2. WHEN compiling the project THEN the system SHALL identify potential type issues.
3. WHEN examining the TypeScript configuration THEN the system SHALL have consistent settings across all configuration files.
4. WHEN adding new code THEN the system SHALL enforce type safety without being overly restrictive.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a standardized application entry point and build configuration so that I can understand how the application bootstraps and builds.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the application entry point THEN the system SHALL have a clear and consistent path.
2. WHEN building the application THEN the system SHALL use optimized and secure build configurations.
3. WHEN looking at the HTML entry point THEN the system SHALL correctly reference the application entry point.

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear code organization principles so that I can understand where to place new components and features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding new components THEN the system SHALL have clear guidelines on where to place them.
2. WHEN examining feature modules THEN the system SHALL have a consistent organization pattern.
3. WHEN looking at shared components THEN the system SHALL have them properly separated from feature-specific components.
