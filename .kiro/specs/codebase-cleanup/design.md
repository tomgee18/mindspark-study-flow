# Design Document

## Overview

This design document outlines the approach for cleaning up and improving the codebase structure, configuration, and organization. The goal is to address the identified inconsistencies, improve type safety, and establish a more maintainable project structure.

## Architecture

The project follows a React application architecture using Vite as the build tool, with TypeScript for type safety. The application is structured using a feature-based organization pattern with shared components and utilities.

## Components and Interfaces

### Directory Structure

The improved directory structure will follow these principles:

1. **Root Level**: Contains only configuration files, entry points, and top-level directories.
2. **Source Organization**: All application code will be contained within the `src` directory.
3. **Feature-based Organization**: Features will be organized in a modular way within the `src/features` directory.
4. **Shared Components**: Common components will be placed in `src/components`.

### Application Entry Point

The application entry point will be standardized to follow Vite's recommended practices:

1. **HTML Entry**: `index.html` at the root level.
2. **Main Entry Point**: `src/main.tsx` (moved from `src/app/main.tsx`).
3. **App Component**: `src/App.tsx` (moved from `src/app/App.tsx`).

### Component Organization

Components will be organized following these principles:

1. **Feature Components**: Components specific to a feature will be placed within that feature's directory.
2. **Shared Components**: Components used across multiple features will be placed in `src/components`.
3. **UI Components**: Basic UI components will be placed in `src/components/ui`.

## TypeScript Configuration

The TypeScript configuration will be improved to enhance type safety while maintaining developer productivity:

1. **Base Configuration**: `tsconfig.json` will contain shared settings.
2. **App Configuration**: `tsconfig.app.json` will contain application-specific settings.
3. **Node Configuration**: `tsconfig.node.json` will contain settings for Node.js environment.

Key improvements include:

1. Enabling `strictNullChecks` to catch potential null/undefined issues.
2. Enabling `noImplicitAny` to ensure proper typing.
3. Enabling `noUnusedLocals` and `noUnusedParameters` to identify unused code.
4. Maintaining path aliases for improved imports.

## Error Handling

The improved codebase will handle errors more effectively through:

1. **Type Safety**: Stricter TypeScript settings will catch potential errors at compile time.
2. **Consistent Patterns**: Establishing consistent error handling patterns across the codebase.

## Testing Strategy

While this design focuses on codebase structure and configuration, it acknowledges the importance of testing:

1. **Testability**: The improved structure will make components more testable by ensuring clear separation of concerns.
2. **Future Testing**: The design will support the addition of testing frameworks and test files in the future.

## Implementation Approach

The implementation will follow these steps:

1. **Fix Directory Structure**: Remove incorrectly named directories and reorganize files.
2. **Improve TypeScript Configuration**: Update TypeScript settings to enhance type safety.
3. **Standardize Entry Points**: Reorganize application entry points for consistency.
4. **Document Organization Principles**: Create documentation for code organization principles.

## Design Decisions

### Decision 1: Feature-based Organization

We will maintain a feature-based organization pattern because it provides better modularity and separation of concerns. This approach allows developers to work on specific features without affecting others.

### Decision 2: Stricter TypeScript Configuration

We will enable stricter TypeScript settings to catch potential issues early in the development process. This will improve code quality and reduce runtime errors.

### Decision 3: Standardized Entry Points

We will standardize the application entry points to follow Vite's recommended practices. This will make the codebase more maintainable and easier to understand for new developers.

### Decision 4: Clear Separation of Shared and Feature-specific Components

We will establish clear guidelines for separating shared and feature-specific components. This will reduce duplication and improve reusability.
