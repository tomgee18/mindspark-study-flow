# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for standardizing the codebase according to global best practices. The goal is to improve code quality, maintainability, and developer experience by implementing industry-standard practices and patterns.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent code formatting and linting rules so that the codebase maintains a uniform style.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the codebase THEN the system SHALL have consistent code formatting across all files.
2. WHEN a developer writes new code THEN the system SHALL enforce consistent code style through automated tools.
3. WHEN running linting commands THEN the system SHALL identify and report style violations.
4. WHEN committing code THEN the system SHALL prevent commits with style violations.

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want improved TypeScript usage and type safety so that I can catch errors early and write more robust code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing TypeScript code THEN the system SHALL enforce proper type definitions.
2. WHEN using external libraries THEN the system SHALL have proper type definitions for those libraries.
3. WHEN defining interfaces and types THEN the system SHALL follow consistent naming conventions.
4. WHEN using React components THEN the system SHALL have proper prop type definitions.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want standardized file and folder structure so that I can easily locate and organize code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the project structure THEN the system SHALL follow a consistent and logical organization.
2. WHEN creating new files THEN the system SHALL have clear guidelines on where to place them.
3. WHEN importing modules THEN the system SHALL use consistent import paths.
4. WHEN organizing components THEN the system SHALL follow a consistent pattern.

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want improved testing infrastructure so that I can ensure code quality and prevent regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing new features THEN the system SHALL have a clear testing strategy.
2. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive coverage reports.
3. WHEN making changes THEN the system SHALL ensure existing functionality is not broken.
4. WHEN writing tests THEN the system SHALL follow consistent testing patterns.

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want standardized state management so that I can manage application state in a consistent and predictable way.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing application state THEN the system SHALL follow consistent patterns.
2. WHEN sharing state between components THEN the system SHALL use appropriate state management solutions.
3. WHEN handling side effects THEN the system SHALL follow consistent patterns.
4. WHEN accessing global state THEN the system SHALL provide a clear and consistent API.

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want improved documentation so that I can understand the codebase and its components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining components THEN the system SHALL have clear documentation on their purpose and usage.
2. WHEN looking at complex logic THEN the system SHALL have explanatory comments.
3. WHEN onboarding new developers THEN the system SHALL have comprehensive documentation.
4. WHEN using shared utilities THEN the system SHALL have documentation on their purpose and usage.
