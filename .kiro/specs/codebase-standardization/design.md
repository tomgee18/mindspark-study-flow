# Design Document

## Overview

This design document outlines the approach for standardizing the codebase according to global best practices. The goal is to improve code quality, maintainability, and developer experience by implementing industry-standard practices and patterns.

## Architecture

The project follows a React application architecture using Vite as the build tool, with TypeScript for type safety. The application is structured using a feature-based organization pattern with shared components and utilities.

## Components and Interfaces

### Code Formatting and Linting

We will implement a comprehensive code formatting and linting setup using the following tools:

1. **Prettier**: For consistent code formatting across all files.
2. **ESLint**: For enforcing code quality rules and best practices.
3. **Husky**: For pre-commit hooks to prevent commits with style violations.
4. **lint-staged**: For running linters on staged files only.

The configuration will follow industry standards for React and TypeScript projects, with customizations specific to our project needs.

### TypeScript Usage

We will improve TypeScript usage by:

1. **Stricter Configuration**: Enabling more strict TypeScript checks in tsconfig files.
2. **Type Definitions**: Ensuring proper type definitions for all code, including external libraries.
3. **Naming Conventions**: Establishing consistent naming conventions for interfaces, types, and generics.
4. **Prop Types**: Ensuring all React components have proper prop type definitions.

### File and Folder Structure

We will standardize the file and folder structure following these principles:

1. **Feature-based Organization**: Organizing code by features, with each feature containing its own components, hooks, and utilities.
2. **Shared Code**: Placing shared code in appropriate directories (components, hooks, utils, etc.).
3. **Consistent Naming**: Using consistent naming conventions for files and folders.
4. **Import Paths**: Using absolute imports with path aliases for better readability and maintainability.

### Testing Infrastructure

We will improve the testing infrastructure by:

1. **Testing Framework**: Setting up Vitest as the testing framework.
2. **Component Testing**: Using React Testing Library for component tests.
3. **Coverage Reports**: Configuring coverage reports to ensure adequate test coverage.
4. **Testing Patterns**: Establishing consistent testing patterns for different types of code.

### State Management

We will standardize state management by:

1. **React Query**: Using React Query for server state management.
2. **Context API**: Using React Context API for global UI state.
3. **Local State**: Using React's useState and useReducer for component-level state.
4. **Side Effects**: Using React Query and useEffect for handling side effects.

### Documentation

We will improve documentation by:

1. **Component Documentation**: Adding JSDoc comments to components and functions.
2. **README Files**: Creating README files for important directories.
3. **Code Comments**: Adding explanatory comments for complex logic.
4. **API Documentation**: Documenting API endpoints and data structures.

## Error Handling

We will implement a consistent error handling strategy:

1. **Error Boundaries**: Using React Error Boundaries for component-level error handling.
2. **API Error Handling**: Implementing consistent error handling for API requests.
3. **User Feedback**: Providing clear error messages to users.
4. **Logging**: Implementing error logging for debugging purposes.

## Testing Strategy

Our testing strategy will focus on:

1. **Unit Tests**: Testing individual functions and components in isolation.
2. **Integration Tests**: Testing interactions between components.
3. **E2E Tests**: Testing complete user flows.
4. **Test Coverage**: Aiming for high test coverage, especially for critical paths.

## Implementation Approach

The implementation will follow these steps:

1. **Setup Tools**: Install and configure code formatting and linting tools.
2. **Update TypeScript Configuration**: Update TypeScript configuration for stricter type checking.
3. **Reorganize Code**: Reorganize code to follow the standardized file and folder structure.
4. **Add Tests**: Add tests for critical functionality.
5. **Improve Documentation**: Add documentation to components and functions.
6. **Standardize State Management**: Refactor state management to follow consistent patterns.

## Design Decisions

### Decision 1: Prettier + ESLint for Code Formatting and Linting

We will use Prettier for code formatting and ESLint for linting. This combination provides the best of both worlds: Prettier for consistent formatting and ESLint for enforcing code quality rules.

### Decision 2: Feature-based Organization

We will maintain a feature-based organization pattern because it provides better modularity and separation of concerns. This approach allows developers to work on specific features without affecting others.

### Decision 3: React Query for Server State Management

We will use React Query for server state management because it provides a powerful and flexible API for fetching, caching, and updating server state.

### Decision 4: JSDoc for Documentation

We will use JSDoc comments for documenting components and functions because they provide a standardized way to document code and can be used to generate documentation.
