# Feature Organization Guidelines

This document outlines the guidelines for organizing features in the MindSpark Study Flow application.

## Feature Structure

Each feature should be organized in a modular way within the `src/features` directory. The structure should follow these guidelines:

```
src/features/
└── feature-name/
    ├── components/     # Feature-specific components
    ├── hooks/          # Feature-specific hooks
    ├── utils/          # Feature-specific utility functions
    ├── types/          # Feature-specific TypeScript types
    ├── api/            # Feature-specific API calls
    ├── context/        # Feature-specific context providers
    └── index.ts        # Public API for the feature
```

## Guidelines

### Feature Naming

- Use kebab-case for feature directory names.
- Use descriptive names that reflect the feature's purpose.

### Feature Components

- Place feature-specific components in `src/features/{feature-name}/components/`.
- Feature components should be focused on a specific feature.
- Feature components can use UI and common components.

### Feature Hooks

- Place feature-specific hooks in `src/features/{feature-name}/hooks/`.
- Hooks should be focused on a specific feature.
- Hooks should be reusable within the feature.

### Feature Utils

- Place feature-specific utility functions in `src/features/{feature-name}/utils/`.
- Utility functions should be pure functions.
- Utility functions should be focused on a specific feature.

### Feature Types

- Place feature-specific TypeScript types in `src/features/{feature-name}/types/`.
- Types should be focused on a specific feature.
- Types should be exported from the feature's public API.

### Feature API

- Place feature-specific API calls in `src/features/{feature-name}/api/`.
- API calls should be focused on a specific feature.
- API calls should use the application's API client.

### Feature Context

- Place feature-specific context providers in `src/features/{feature-name}/context/`.
- Context providers should be focused on a specific feature.
- Context providers should be exported from the feature's public API.

### Feature Public API

- Export the feature's public API from `src/features/{feature-name}/index.ts`.
- Only export what is needed by other parts of the application.
- Keep implementation details private.

## Best Practices

1. **Feature Isolation**: Features should be isolated from each other.
2. **Dependency Direction**: Features should depend on shared code, not on other features.
3. **Feature Boundaries**: Respect feature boundaries and avoid cross-feature dependencies.
4. **Feature Testing**: Write tests for feature components and logic.
5. **Feature Documentation**: Document complex feature logic.
6. **Feature Accessibility**: Ensure feature components are accessible.
